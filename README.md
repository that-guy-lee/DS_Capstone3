# Recurrent Neural Network Book Review Classification
### This was a task that I completed while studying through HyperionDev.

This code uses the Recurrent Neural Network model as well as NLP to classify a book review as either positive or negative.
It is written in a Jupyter notebook



## Installation

1) Clone the repo
2) Install Jupyter
```bash
    pip install notebook
```
3) Change directory into the repo
4) Install all requirements
5) View the notebook 
```bash
  jupyter notebook

```
